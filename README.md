# ChallanEase
This E-Challan Generation System is a mini-project developed by our team under the leadership of me, Mrudhula E . The project uses the YOLO model to detect vehicle number plates and helmet violations from an image, and OCR is used to extract the vehicle number automatically. The challan form is then auto-filled based on the detected details, and the officer can select the violation from a dropdown to generate the challan in just one step. We built the system as a PWA so it works smoothly on mobile devices and can even be installed like an app. This project aims to make the challan generation process faster, easier, and more accurate for traffic officers.
